**Technology fueling exponential discipleship, leadership, and church reproduction.**

We believe the next decade can see **1 billion people become disciples of Jesus** through tools and relationships that will exponentially reproduce disciples, leaders, and communities of Christ.

Our starting point is **translation** — because God’s Word and life-giving training must be accessible to everyone in their **heart language**. From there, we’ll move into **distribution** and other scalable systems that support the global disciple-making, leader-raising, and church-reproducing movement.

## 🚀 Why Translation First?

Billions still lack access to discipleship resources in their language. That’s where we begin:

- Simple, **mobile-centric** tools anyone can use.
- Support for **collaborative translation and review**.
- Built for **low bandwidth and global accessibility**.

This is the first wave. Many more will follow.

## 🌱 What’s Coming
As our team grows, we’ll launch **multiple projects concurrently**, all designed to accelerate exponential growth:

- **Distribution platforms** — delivering resources into millions of hands.
- **AI-assisted tools** — translation, editing, and quality review at scale.
- **Training and coaching systems** — equipping leaders and reproducing Christ communities.
- **Communications systems** — enabling global connection, sharing, and coordination.
- **Administration systems** — streamlining movement-wide collaboration across the world.
- **Lightweight mobile apps** — discipleship and multiplication, anywhere and everywhere.

## 🤝 Why Get Involved Now?
- Be part of the **ground floor** of a global tech-for-mission movement.
- Shape the **architecture** before it scales worldwide.
- Use your skills to help **make disciples, raise leaders, and reproduce churches** on an exponential level.
- Collaborate with innovators passionate about **eternal impact**.
- Contribute to a vision that is **open-handed** — all resources are released **freely under CC0 (Public Domain)** so the global body of Christ can adapt, reuse, and multiply without restriction.
